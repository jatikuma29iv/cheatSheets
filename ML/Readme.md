# ML

Job of a `data scientist/analyst` is to find the best `algorithm` for a given problem
and make sure that the data when `modeled` is consumable by the `algorithm`.

## Roadmap

  ### Statistics and Maths

  - differential equations
  - linear algebra
  - matrix multiplications
  - scalars
  - vector
  - matrix
  - probability

### Skills
1. Prog Lang: Python or R
2. Stats & Maths: differential equations, linear algebra, matrix multiplication, vector, matrices, scalas, probability
3. dbms: sql, no sql: mongodb, cassandra, dynamodb (aws)
4. ml & dl: advanced dl (object detection, euler algo, kinds of transfer learnings), libraries related to dl: tensorflow, keras, pytorch
5. big data: basic arch. for hadoop (small proj), pig, hive, flumes
6. nlp: chatbots, sentiment analysis - political, stock market via news; nlu - conversational ai chatbots
7. git: bitbucket, git cli
8. reporting tools: power bi, tableau, qlicksense
9. deployment techniques: azure, aws, cloud frontry, heroku (platform as a service) paas vs iaas, differences b/w them, adv, disadv
10. cloud computing services: azure, aws - kinesis stream, s3 bucket
11. devops: kubernetes, docker

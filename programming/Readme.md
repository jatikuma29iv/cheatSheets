## Gaps/Challenges

### Deployment/Release
* The `Environment Config` is not loosly coupled from the code
* We do not have `release scripts` for creating release and setting up `Environment`
* The deployment engineer lacks the skills of creating and executing `release scripts`

### Branding Assets
* The `branding assets` are part of the code
* `build scripts` for setting up code are missing

### Development

### Jenkins
* Jenkins helps quickly setting up QA/Staing Env, however, Production release still becomes a manual activity
* `release scripts` can solve the problem
  * `release scripts` will be use by `Jenkins`
  * and same can be used in prod manually to automate Prod deployment

## Development
### Environment Variables

#### IIS Deployment

IIS works with `web.config`.
Keep all the `Environment` specific configuration in it. eg:
* Database Connection
* Urls to other services

In case there are multiple services deployed. Use on top level `Web.config`

#### Stratagy 1: Refrencial folder
* the deployment structure of the code will be fixed
* the root folder of the deployment will have the `Environment Settings` `yml`

#### Stratagy 2: Commandline Utility
* `GoLang` utility `xxx` will store all the `Environment Settings` in `yml`
* these `Environment Settings` will be accessed with respet to the
  * tenant
  * installation folder
  * the codes config will not have the identifier

#### Core Lib to access Env
* `Core Lib` will have method to provide `Environment Settings`

## Installation
### Script
* `Apps Installation Script` should
  * access `Environment Settings` for
    * DB Server
    * DB Name
  * Setup DataBase
  * Do not set the DB Config in the app.config

## Core Lib Development
* Core files will be in separate git repo `Core Repo`
* Each app will include the `Core Repo` as a `git submodule`

## UI Development
Please read
* [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
* [Core Lib Development](#core-lib-development)

### Structure
Typically the UI is composed of:
* UI Components
* Controllers
* Assets (Css/img)
* Business Services

#### Approach
Approach should be keep above 3 decoupled
Assets should be kept in separate repo. It should be copied to `Assets` folder for App development.

### Quick Start
TBD

## API Development
Please read
* [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
* [Core Lib Development](#core-lib-development)

### Quick Start
TBD

## Deployment

### Vanila Deployment VM
* Box to test the Installation
* QA will check if the system can be deployed using the `Apps Installation Script`
